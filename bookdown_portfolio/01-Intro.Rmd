What came first, the teacher or the learner? A nonsensical question for an important topic. Throughout this portfolio I will guide you through what I have learnt about teaching.

I teach bioinformatics/computational biology to life scientists through a University genome centre & NERC omics facility. We provide easily accessible online workshops to researchers across the UK. For this I have heavily invested in learning digital technologies to make workshops smooth and inclusive.

Self reflections have shown me how I am an effective teacher. Carrying out pedagogical research has shown me how to improve. I am now incorporating Learning Outcomes, improving course onboarding, and adding MCQs into my digital materials.

I will repeat myself multiple times through this portfolio. But, repetition is key to learning. I have strived to demonstrate that I fulfil all the UKPSF mappings and that I meet descriptor 2 of the UKPSF.

As part of this intro I will introduce you to some of my sayings and catch phrases I have in regards to teaching.

"There is no such thing as a stupid question, just stupid answers by me". A phrase I say to my learners to encourage questions with humour.

"Difficult topics can't be made easy, but learning can". I try to facilitate the best learning. Failure to learn is not always failure of the learner.

I teach in a "Smart Casual approach". I try to be an engaging, informative, approachable, and inclusive teacher.

## Growth

I became a teacher because I was a learner. I saw so many poor practices & so many good practices. Through this and experience I have developed my own teaching style. I have a deep passion for teaching and I want my learners to be engaged whilst gaining valuable skills & knowledge.

I want to continue teaching and have it as my primary role. I aim to complete this PGCAP & continue onto the PGMA. As part of this I would like to disseminate my findings and practices to other teachers. I am currently trying to become the CGR (Centre for Genomic Research) training manager.

I hope that has given you a taste of this portfolio. Please enjoy the rest.
