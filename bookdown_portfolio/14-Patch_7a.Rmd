For this patch I had a list of questions to prepare followed by an interview style discussion where I was asked some of the questions. This was a nice way to reflect on and discuss my teaching practices in a more informal manner.

For this discussion I wrote out a list of notes for each question. I made them quite light and then practiced these answers a few times each. This is generally how I practice presentations and explanations. I don't use a script instead having points I can improvise from. This leads to a more natural way of talking without forgetting important details. I do not have the memory to go completely off the cuff. I also find it would be quite a disorganised conversation and I would probably jump about a lot. Equally, a script would not be good as I am not good at live reading, generally having an awkward rhythm and pronouncing words wrong. Instead, I am a more confident public speaker when I have practiced and I have a good structure to go from.

Below are the questions we had for preparation and the notes I used for practicing and during the discussion.

**Describe for us methods for monitoring and evaluating your own teaching practice that you have so far used in your current post and role.  How have any of these methods directly impacted on your own practice to date?**

-   Main methods I use are:

## Review

The preparation, discussion, and marker feedback were all positive and fruitful. I hope my passion for teaching and the pride in my work came through. My marker feedback indicates that is the case which I am happy about. The feedback also encouraged me to try to further disseminate my work and evaluating my workbooks for my next PGCAP module. I think this is a great idea and what I will use it for my research project.
