# Welcome

Welcome, this is my portfolio for the PGCAP (Postgraduate Certificate of Academic Practice) I completed in 2024.
In essence the course is a degree for higher education (i.e. education at the University level).

The portfolio covers many topics and is related to teaching bioinformatics primarily to PhD students and early career researchers.

In the portfolio each section is split into two. The first is a more informal introduction to the topic/s. The second is a more formal essay/report with citations. Feel free to read only the first parts which summarise the most important points in the second part. I hope you find it interesting and engaging.

For the true introduction please read onto the next page.

# (PART\*) Intro {-}

# The Starting line

<center>
![](figures/finish_flag.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px"}
</center>

What came first, the teacher or the learner? A nonsensical question for an important topic. Throughout this portfolio I will guide you through what I have learnt about teaching.

I teach bioinformatics/computational biology to life scientists through a University genome centre & NERC omics facility. We provide easily accessible online workshops to researchers across the UK. For this I have heavily invested in learning digital technologies to make workshops smooth and inclusive.

Self reflections have shown me how I am an effective teacher. Carrying out pedagogical research has shown me how to improve. I am now incorporating Learning Outcomes, improving course onboarding, and adding MCQs into my digital materials.

I will repeat myself multiple times through this portfolio. But, repetition is key to learning. I have strived to demonstrate that I fulfil all the UKPSF mappings and that I meet descriptor 2 of the UKPSF.

## "Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn". -Benjamin Franklin

<center>
![](figures/kite.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px"}
</center>

As part of this intro I will introduce you to some of my sayings and catch phrases I have in regards to teaching.

"There is no such thing as a stupid question, just stupid answers by me". A phrase I say to my learners to encourage questions with humour.

"Difficult topics can't be made easy, but learning can". I try to facilitate the best learning. Failure to learn is not always failure of the learner.

I teach in a "Smart Casual approach". I try to be an engaging, informative, approachable, and inclusive teacher.

## Growth

<center>
![](figures/bracken.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px"}
</center>

I became a teacher because I was a learner. I saw so many poor practices & so many good practices. Through this and experience I have developed my own teaching style. I have a deep passion for teaching and I want my learners to be engaged whilst gaining valuable skills & knowledge.

I want to continue teaching and have it as my primary role. I aim to complete this PGCAP & continue onto the PGMA. As part of this I would like to disseminate my findings and practices to other teachers. I am currently trying to become the CGR (Centre for Genomic Research) training manager.

I hope that has given you a taste of this portfolio. Please enjoy the rest.

# (PART\*) Self-Evaluation and Reflection {-}

# Reflection or: Considering my strengths and weaknesses

<center>
![](figures/reflection.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

This patch starts off this Portfolio with a common theme of reflection. It gave me a chance to explore my strengths and areas of improvements in many different areas.

## Strengths

<center>
![](figures/strength.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

At this point my known strengths include:

- Long experience of creating, organising, and running bioinformatics workshops for postgrads (A1 & A2).
- I create online teaching environments with various technologies (Zoom, OBS, Slack, R Bookdown, and webVNC) (A4 & K4).
- I have attended teaching courses and am an AFHEA via the FLTHE course (A5).
- I am a knowledgeable and experienced practitioner of my topic (Bioinformatics) (K1).
- I gain student feedback verbally and through google forms for each workshop (K5).

## Improvements

<center>
![](figures/hammer.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

Just as important my areas of improvement include:

- Increasing my pedagogical knowledge and qualifications. Ideally, I would like to continue and complete the MA of academic practice.
- I teach primarily through workshops and would like more experience and knowledge of different teaching approaches and aspects of academic teaching.
- More patience for learners asking questions covered in materials.
- Motivating unmotivated learners.
- Leadership, conflict management, & delegation skills.
- Gaps in my knowledge & skills within bioinformatics.
- Incorporating MCQs into my materials (A3).
- Providing continuing support to workshop attendees (A4).

## Literature

<center>
![](figures/literature-1.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}
</center>

Prior to this PGCAP I had read a good amount of literature for my FLTHE (A5). During the PGCAP I plan to read Phil Race's "The Lecturer's Toolkit A Practical Guide to Assessment, Learning and Teaching" which I started in my FLTHE.

## Conclusion & plan

<center>
![](figures/plan.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

My feedback was very positive mainly aiming to point me to various other frameworks and drivers.

I am a confident teacher. I run a lot of workshops with a great team and we receive very positive feedback. We run online workshops with very appropriate technologies. We aim to have very good materials the learners follow so they can work at their own pace. This in addition to us trying to be very approachable aims to create a very inclusive and collaborative environment (V2). Or, as I like to call it a "smart casual" environment.

With all this my plans of improvement are:

- Include formative assessment in the online materials via MCQs and drop down help boxes.
- Learn new bioinformatics skills/knowledge that learners want/need.
- Improve my conflict management skills and patience.
- Improve my pedagogical knowledge.
- Provide better formative feedback to learners.
- Learn how to motivate learners better.

# Self evaluation form

This page contains my answers to a self evaluation form.

## Teaching Skills 

For example, previous teaching experience and qualifications, classroom/online teaching, facilitating, mentoring and coaching skills, planning, assessment.

### Strengths

I am good at writing materials, running online workshops, planning & organisation of
workshops, hosting and presenting. I have run a lot of bioinformatics based
workshops. I ask my colleagues for verbal feedback on my materials and
presentations and their feedback is very encouraging. We also ask for feedback from
students via a google form (K5). The feedback is generally very positive with
emphasis on learners liking the materials and the friendly and knowledgeable
instructors (including me).
I have finished my FLTHE and I am an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education
academy.

### Areas of Development

I would like to Increase my pedagogical theory, including how to assess students. I
would like to improve my skill in running more collaborative sessions (such as
seminars). I have a good amount of teaching experience but very little official
qualifications (highest degree earned is a MSc in bioinformatics).

## Knowledge of Learning and Teaching 

For example, other teaching/training qualifications, courses/workshops attended, reading around learning, teaching and assessment, application of theory to practice.

### Strengths 

I have a lot of experience of teaching bioinformatics to postgrads and ECRs (7 years).
This has involved Leading, Co-leading, or instructing in 40 workshops that last
between 1-4 days (mostly 2 days) (A2). Additionally, I have created and run my own
“R for Everyone” online workshop through Continuing Education 3 times since 2020
(A1). This is an evening course held for 2 hours once a week over 8 weeks.

I am keen to learn to become a better teacher and have attended the FLTHE course
and a “Train the trainers” workshop in Stockholm (A5).

### Areas of Development 

I would like to improve my pedagogical knowledge and gain higher teaching
qualifications. I hope to continue into the MA of Academic Practice after the PGCAP. I
would also like to gain a better understanding of other types of teaching and the
aspects of academic teaching I do not know (organising modules, assessment etc).

## Characteristics of a lecturer 

For example, qualities, knowledge and skills you bring to teaching - subject knowledge,
inspiring students, active learning, time management, willingness to try out new approaches.

### Strengths 

I can create a good online teaching environment by using technology to try to break
the distance (K4). Since 2020 I have developed my digital teaching skills and tools
and I am constantly trying to learn more. This has involved learning how to create
digital books via bookdown to make attractive and visually pleasing HTML
documents. I host these on the CGR server so learners can easily open these up via a
link. I have learnt to use github so I can collaborate on making these bookdowns with
my colleagues. I have learnt to use a streaming program called OBS that allows me to
switch what I am showing easily so I can change from only a webcam to my
presentation to a screen that I can live code on. I now also use Slack as a good text
frum for my workshops.

I am very knowledgeable in my field and have a passion to teach it well (K1).
Although I have a MSc in Bioinformatics I would say I learnt most of my skills on the
job and so I know how frustrating it can be to learn. Working for genomic centres as
a bioinformatician means I am carrying out analysis of lots of different datasets. This
gives me a good breadth of knowledge , useful for teaching lots of different
bioinformatic workflows. Throughout my career I have worked on at least 50
different projects varying from viral to butterfly genomics.

I am generally quite empathetic and try to not take the things I know for granted.

I am well organised with good time management skills. I always ensure to have lists
of tasks to do as I do not have the best memory so I have had to keep notes like this
for all my life. Although I am paid for 100% NEOF training workshops I also carry out
CGR projects, solely design and run CGR workshops, teach undergraduates, HPC
administration. In essence it is like I am carrying out 2 jobs whilst only working 4 days
a week.

### Areas of Development 

I can sometimes get annoyed when learners ask questions that are covered in the
materials. I try my best to not get annoyed or at least not show my annoyance.
Gaining some more patience for this would be good.
I find it difficult to motivate unmotivated learners. Some learners are happy with my
explanation as to why bioinformatics is important. However, I have met many
undergrad biological students who do not like bioinformatics at all. Many go into
biology with an interest in field or lab work so they do not think computational
knowledge will be needed. Convincing them that bioinformatics is important can be
difficult and I would like to know how to motivate them aside from the threat of low
grades and job prospects. Unfortunately even with all the reason in the world, when
someone hears an answer they do not like they tend to ignore it.
I do not have much experience of being a formal leader of colleagues. Having more
confidence when doing this would be good. I generally do not like to bother people
so I have some issues with delegation of tasks if people are not happy to volunteer.

## Subject Knowledge and other relevant skills, attributes 

For example, range and depth of subject knowledge, both own subject and learning and teaching, interpersonal skills, communication skills.

### Strengths

I have a broad knowledge of bioinformatics with a deeper knowledge in microbial
bioinformatics. This initially comes from a BSc in Microbiology and MSc in
Bioinformatics which has developed throughout my work.

I consider myself a good self taught teacher. I receive very good feedback from
learners, colleagues, and my bosses. This comes from feedback that I ask for verbally
and via learner feedback forms (K5).

I am a good public speaker and host. I know the importance of rehearsing
presentations prior to giving them. I enjoy the spotlight and would say I have a
certain charm. Our workshop feedback regularly has comments on how friendly the
teachers are and how our workshops have succeeded where other workshops (from
other providers) have failed.

### Areas of Development 

There are knowledge and skill gaps I have in my field that would be good to improve.
This involves some advanced topics such as machine learning, and certain languages
I am not confident in (e.g. python). These are becoming more important in the field
and learners are requesting these via our feedback form.

My greatest weakness in interpersonal skills is my conflict management as I try to
avoid conflict. More and more I know it is an important skill in work and teaching.
Due to cultural or language differences learners can come across as aggressive. For
example I recently had a learner who would start by saying he wanted to argue with
me but then ask me a normal question or for my assistance. Being able to identify
real conflict and knowing how to manage it would be a very useful skill to maintain a
comfortable, inclusive, and safe environment for everyone.

## Professional Skills Framework

Please read and reflect on the Areas of Activity on page 3 of the UK Professional Standards Framework to complete this section.

### Strengths 

A1: I design and plan workshops that last from 1-4 days. I run these more than once
a month.

A2: I teach and support learning via workshops for postgrads and modules for
undergraduates.

A4: I use very appropriate methods for teaching online workshops. This is through
the use of HTML books, slack, zoom, OBS, and webVNCs (browser based virtual
computers). OBS allows me to quickly change what I am showing so I can
host,present, show code etc.

A5: I have started on improving my pedagogy through completion of FLTHE and
moving onto this PGCAP. I try to keep up with literature and new tools and methods
in my field.

### Areas of Development 

A3: I currently only provide verbal feedback to learners. I want to incorporate MCQs
into my HTML bookdowns so learners can see how well they are understanding the
materials. If they do not get it correct I would like there to be a dropdown box that
will elucidate the correct answer. When/if I get more involved in undergraduate
teaching I would like to know how to effectively provide feedback. Other ways to
provide feedback would be useful to know.

A4: Providing continuing support to learners can be difficult in a workshop format. It
would be nice to know how I can accommodate continued guidance. Currently we
leave the Slack channel open for the workshops so people can ask us questions but
they have never used this. We also have started organising times when previous
workshop learners can have a 1 to 1 with one of us. This is so we can try to help
them in their current analysis.

## Reflection

Reflect on the completion of the Part One of the self-evaluation; justify your decisions with regards to your current
learning, teaching and assessment practices. Please also think about D2 of the UKPSF (page 5) to identify scope for
enhancement with some clear action points (no more than 500 words)

I am happy with my current teaching skills and practice. I design and run bioinformatics-based online workshops
(A1, A2). We send out feedback forms to our workshop attendees and we generally get very positive feedback. I
definitely have room for improvement and am aiming to formalise my teaching skills and qualifications via this
PGCAP and beyond.

An advantage of online workshops is that we can run them over 2 days split in the middle by a break day. The
workshops run from 10-4pm. I find that having shorter than full days and having a break day helps reduce cognitive
load.

I primarily focus my workshops on the learners following a HTML which contains theory, practice, and exercises. I
chose this method as active learning is a good way to teach practical skills, such as bioinformatics (K2, K3). The
HTML book I create with R bookdown is a quick way to make well formatted documents whilst including figures. A
well structured, visually pleasing document that can be read on a phone, tablet, or screen, makes reading and
absorbing the information easier.

An important part of teaching is creating a suitable teaching environment. I try a “smart casual” environment. I want
to present myself as “smart” so the learners trust my expertise and knowledge. I also want to be “casual” so learners
are comfortable to ask questions. This helps create a collaborative environment (V2).

To create an accessible online environment I utilise Slack, Zoom, and OBS (A4, K4). Slack works as a good text hub
whilst Zoom is a good place for voice and video. I utilise OBS as a streaming tool so I can change what I am showing
so I can present, then show a terminal to live code quickly. This allows me to carry out improvisational teaching. We
use a webVNC for our coding workshops. This is a link that the learner can open in their browser to use our virtual
computers with all required tools installed. It allows us to log into their virtual computer so we can see their code
and help them with issues.

I am in a slightly different position to many other academic teachers. I primarily teach postgrad, ECRs, and other
academics via workshops. I am therefore missing a lot of experience that others have.

I plan to improve my teaching with the PGCAP and with the following action plan alongside it:

- Include formative assessment in the online materials via MCQs and drop down help boxes.
- Learn new bioinformatics skills/knowledge that learners want/need.
- Improve my conflict management skills and patience.
- Improve my pedagogical knowledge.
- Provide better formative feedback to learners.
- Learn how to motivate learners better.

A big reason for attending this course is to gain a qualification. Qualifications can be useful as a shorthand for
learners and other colleagues to respect your skills. This can be an issue when you do not have a PhD (which I do
not). Ultimately, I want to teach to the best of my ability and create inclusive and effective learning environments.

## Literature
What key pedagogic literature have you read/or intend to read to support you with your teaching practices?

For my FLTHE I read the following literature (A5):

# (PART\*) Digital Storytelling {-}

# My Smart Casual Approach or: Taking the good and avoiding poor practices

<center>
![](figures/shirt-1.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}
</center>

The topic I covered with my Digital Storytelling was my "Smart Casual" teaching approach. I gained this by watching my previous teachers and taking the good practices and leaving the poor practices. As Phil race says, avoiding poor practices can lead to effective learning (V3)(P Race, 2019).

## Good & poor practices

<center>
![](figures/drama.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

Two types of teachers I have experienced are:

- Mr Casual: Engaging but informative.
- Professor Smart: Informative but dull.

Therefore my "Smart Casual" approach aims to be:

- Engaging
  - Storytelling, Case studies, and interesting context (K3 & V3)(Hoffer, 2020)
  - Interactive digital materials with literature, practice, exercises, MCQs, & videos (K4)(Bikowski & Casal, 2018)
- Informative
  - Working memory is limited, therefore teach what is relevant and don’t explain every single minutiae (K3)(Paas & van Merriënboer, 2020)
  - Extra materials & Further online resources can improve higher order thinking skills (K4)(Purnomo et al, 2020)
- Inclusivity
  - Work at own pace (V1)(Clark et al, 2019)
  - Humour & praise encourages participation & positive environment (A4 & V2)(Lovorn & Holaway, 2015)

## Conclusion

<center>
![](figures/film_projector.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}
</center>

This patch gave me a chance to practice recording a talk and watching it back. I have a lot of practice recording my presentations but like most people I don't like hearing my recorded voice. Therefore I don't watch my recordings as often as I should. This is something I intend to change.

My "Smart casual" teaching approach is a good approach for me that is backed by literature. Of course it is not the best approach for everyone as everyone is different but it always good to avoid poor practices. 

As my feedback advises I will continue to try to develop by reading literature, reflecting, and exploring University policies and specifically the Liverpool Curriculum Framework in patch 4.

# Curious Archive or: Books that question you

<center>
![](figures/question_book.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}
</center>

In this patch I explore how to incorporate formative assessment into my materials. Due to the nature of my workshops I do not grade learners through assessments such as course work and exams. My learners come to the workshop and are then gone. To counteract this I am now adding Interactive Multiple Choice Questions in my HTML books (A5).

## Benefits of formative assessment

<center>
![](figures/benefit.png){style="width:200px"}
</center>

Being a previous student can give you a disdain for assessments. However if done correctly formative assessment activities can:

- Be beneficial and enjoyable for students (Adkins, 2018).
- Help students monitor their progress and encourage further study (V2) (McCallum & Milner, 2021).
- Incorporate aspects of a flipped classroom, decreasing cognitive load and supporting a diverse group of students in their learning (V1) (Cortese et al., 2022).

## MCQs

<center>
![](figures/quiz.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}
</center>

I am now incorporating interactive MCQs into my digital materials. These MCQs aim to improve the quality of learning (K6). The principles of MCQ design I use are:

- Three answer options as the optimal amount (V3) (Rodriguez, 2005).
- Incorporating macro design strategies, such as interspersed answers (V3) (Söbke & Mosebach, 2020)

The specific benefits of digital MCQs for bioinformatics teaching are:

- Practically feasible, and easily created by me.
- Intuitive for learners, and provide instant feedback (K4) (Snekalatha et al., 2021).
- Reattempting questions is allowed and is beneficial to learning (Zhang et al., 2021).
- Perfect for reinforcing definitions & theory (K2).
  - A lot of programming is using search engines with the correct terminology (K1).
- Recap MCQs can reinforce terminology via repetition, promoting recall (K3) (Yang, 2019).
- A vital skill to learn in data science is investigating the coding output (Via, 2022).
  - MCQs can be used to ask learners to explore and interrogate output (K2).
  - The MCQ options guide learners helping their progress (A4) (Kojo et al., 2018).
  
## Monitoring & further plans

<center>
![](figures/periscope.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}
</center>

I am monitoring the usefulness and clarity of the MCQs and e-materials through verbal and written feedback (K5). This will allow me to reflect on and revise my materials (Foley, 2020). It is currently very positive but can be improved. I would like to create a diagnostic assessment in the future for learners to run through prior to the workshop (A3). This would allow me and the learner to know if they have the prerequisite skills to the correct level. If they do not they could run through prerequisite materials so they can reach the proficiency prior to the workshop (V1, V2) (McClatchy et al., 2020).

## Feedback & conclusion

<center>
![](figures/feedback.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}
</center>

Feedback I received for this patch was positive. The main question was the enquiry of the feedback I am receiving. In terms of metrics the MCQs primarily receive Excellent and Average results of a question "The use of the multiple choice questions was" (options are excellent, good, average, and poor) with no poor results. Although good, it trended towards the lower scale than are other questions. I have not received any specific comments yet. There are many of my other workshops that have not run with the added MCQs so I would like to await some judgement until I receive more feedback on them. In terms of the digital materials themselves we receive primarily good and excellent results for the coursebook, structure of the coursebook and its clarity. Some people still like to have a printed version which we provide.

This patch has been very beneficial in my incorporation of formative assessments with the correct implementation. The in-material MCQs have been generally well received and I have noticed a lot less clarifying questions when it comes to interpreting output and exercises. It has been very beneficial in teaching them the noise from the signal. This is a big issue in bioinformatics output files that I naturally learnt and so have struggled to teach in the past.

# Embracing Formative feedback

As a teacher who primarily creates and runs data science workshops for postgrads and early career researchers I have not had a chance to create or mark assessments (A1, A2).
Naturally, I also gained an unfavourable opinion towards assessment as a student.
However, through my learning in this course and through a digital learning site (brilliant.org) I have recently come to see the positives of using assessment to improve learning.
Previously I included exercises in the courses.
Now I am also incorporating MCQs (Multiple-Choice Questions) into my html books (A5).
In the future I aim to create some form of pre-assessment for my workshops.
Of course, formative assessment works best when an appropriate form of feedback is included with it.

My teaching is carried out through workshops which are not graded.
Therefore, I try to incorporate formative assessment into my teaching.
This formative assessment is carried out through exercises that I have used extensively, asking verbal questions to learners, and through MCQs that I am now incorporating into my e-materials.
These forms of formative assessment are useful to help learning by giving time for students to stop reading and practising, and instead apply their new knowledge and skills through active learning.
When done correctly these activities can be beneficial to learning and be enjoyable (Adkins, 2018).
Formative assessments help students monitor their progress and encourage further study (V2) (McCallum & Milner, 2021).
Incorporating these activities within the materials and having the courses being self-paced by learners incorporates aspects of a flipped classroom which can decrease cognitive load and supports a diverse group of students in their learning (V1) (Cortese et al., 2022).

I have always included exercises in my computational biology materials.
This gives learners an opportunity to put into action what they have learnt.
They will have to think about what they are doing and why they are doing it.
I have 3 forms of feedback for these exercises:

1.  I ensure these exercises have a clear output such as the exact file or visualisation they need to create. I attempt to make it clear when they have completed it successfully or not.
2.  I include an answer chapter. This includes the code I used along with annotation that includes the how and why of my code. The answers are useful so they can peak if they get stuck and it allows them to use the materials in the future outside of the workshop environment.
3.  I am on hand to assist, answer questions, and provide feedback (A3). I have a streaming set up so I can quickly show them my working environment and demonstrate how to carry out any coding task if I or the learners feel it is necessary.

Although I provide all this information coding exercises can be a form of subjective assessment as there are many ways to do the same thing in coding.
The intended takeaway for learners is that they understand why their code worked or not and they know how to start the process of fixing any errors.

Due to going to online workshops, I changed to creating digital html books rather than normal documents.
To create these I use an R package called bookdown.
I am now adding in MCQs into these bookdowns as a form of formative assessment to improve the quality of learning (K6).
I use three answer options as the optimal amount (V3) (Rodriguez, 2005).
Additionally, I am incorporating macro design strategies, such as interspersed answers, to create my MCQs (V3) (Söbke & Mosebach, 2020).

These MCQs are digital and the learner can select the answer on the html.
The primary benefits of these digital MCQs is that they are practically feasible, easily created by me and utilised by the learners, and they provide instant feedback (K4) (Snekalatha et al., 2021).
Additionally, the learner can reattempt the question if they chose the wrong option.
Allowing for reattempts within formative assessment is beneficial to learning (Zhang et al., 2021).
Due to the nature of MCQs they are very good for objective assessment, where there is only one answer.

Perfect uses of MCQs are to reinforce definitions & theory, and to explore output (K2).
When learning programming it is very useful to learn the terminology (aka jargon).
This is vital to allow for future learning as a lot of programming is using search engines with the correct terminology (K1).
This can be difficult as terminology can be unintuitive or clash with other programming languages.
Therefore having recap MCQs to reinforce terminology via repetition can be very useful to promote recall (K3) (Yang, 2019).

A large part of data science is investigating the coding output, whether it is a text file or a visualisation.
Learning this skill is therefore vital (Via, 2022).
Using MCQs, combined with good explanations of the output, to ask learners to pick out certain parts of the output is a very good technique to learn this skill (K2).
This simultaneously gives learners a clear and concise instruction with an achievable goal.
In this form the MCQs act as guiding questions that help them progress in their learning (A4) (Kojo et al., 2018).
This helps them pick out the useful information versus the unneeded noise.

I am monitoring the acceptance of my e-materials and teaching by feedback forms given to students after the workshops.
This includes asking students their opinion on the effectiveness and clarity of the e-materials and MCQs (K5).
This allows me to reflect on and revise my materials to improve them for future workshop cohorts (Foley, 2020).
Currently the feedback is very positive but with room for improvement.

In the future I would like to create some form of online quiz to use as a diagnostic assessment(A3).
It would be perfect if I could set it up for each course and each student could carry out the assessment.
Afterwards it would tell them which of my current pre-course materials they should run through prior to the course.
This would encourage the learners to run through the prerequisite materials which aim to bring all learners to the level of proficiency required for the workshop (V1, V2) (McClatchy et al., 2020).

I have learnt how assessment can be a vital teaching and learning tool and not just a tool of discrimination.
I have always used exercises and tried to help learners by questioning them in certain ways rather than just tell them the answer.
Now I am including MCQs in my html materials to reinforce terminology and concepts as well as to focus their investigation of the file and visualisation outputs they make in the workshop.

# Mittens or: Finding the right gloves

<center>
![](figures/mittens.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}
</center>

I am in a unique position in terms of teaching in higher education. I teach workshops that last days rather than modules that last weeks. Instead of teaching undergraduates I teach postgraduates and research staff (A1). However, the team I am part of now run a series of workshops over a year. This has given me the impetus to reflect on curriculum design (A5). To improve on this I focussed on the core value and six hallmarks of the Liverpool curriculum framework.

## Benefits of formative assessment

<center>
![](figures/core_7_hallmarks.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}
</center>

Throughout this patch I reflect on how I currently meet the core value and six hallmarks of the Liverpool curriculum framework.

Core value: Inclusivity

- Online workshops are more accessible as no need to organise travel and accommodation (V2).
- Our Workshops are 1-2 days, running from 10am-4pm with 3 breaks amounting to 1.5 hours. We use this time schedule to be inclusive to people of different needs (V1).
- Allow anonymous participation as anxiety is a barrier to learning (Sathy & Hogan, 2019).
- Set etiquette at start of workshop to promote respect of each other and our differences (V1) (Muñiz, 2019).

Active learning, Research-connected learning, and authentic assessment.

- Teach digital fluency of UK environmental scientists via bioinformatics (A2 & V4).
  - Vital to modern molecular biologists (K1) (Cao et al, 2020).
  - Improves research and future employability (V4).
- Produce research-connected training, sharing our research experiences, making it relevant and therefore improving understanding (Lu et al, 2017) (K2).
- Active learning via self paced materials with theory, practice, MCQs, and exercises.
  - Active learning is a central tenet of scientific teaching, a useful pedagogical framework for bioinformatics (K2, K3, K4, & V3) (Miller et al,  2008).
- Authentic assessment through self-assessment.
  - Students provided exercises with solutions allowing training-supported formative self-assessment which deepens learning (Andrade, 2019).
  - We Provide learners with feedback when they ask for help. We can evaluate their solution and understanding (A3, & K5).

Encourage confidence, global citizenship, and digital fluency of students

- Workshop icebreakers helps establish a learning environment and introduce scientists in the same field to each other, helping global citizenship (V2 & V3) (Mustafa & Yukselturk, 2022).
- Provide introductory workshops which act as prerequisites to future workshops (K2).
  - Ease learners into bioinformatics promoting digital fluency and confidence (V1).
- Provide online materials which promotes confidence with self-directed learning (A4, K4, V1, & V2) (Mello, 2016).

## Feedback & conclusion

![](figures/gold.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}
</center>

Feedback for this patch was very positive, agreeing that I utilise the the core value and six hallmarks of the Liverpool curriculum framework. Evidence of the success of this was asked about. In terms of inclusivity we get many comments saying the teachers were very friendly and approachable. Some of the best feedback we get are learners saying they went to a different workshop which they found confusing but our workshop made the topic clear. In fact, people enjoy our workshops so much they register for workshops in fields and topics they don't need for their research. They have said they do this because they find our workshops so informative and fun. This caused a problem for us because we want people who will benefit the most to attend each specific workshop. This would not be a problem if our workshops were not constantly oversubscribed but they are. Of course, our workshops being too popular is a nice problem to have compared to the real Midas touch.

The primary benefit of this patch was linking my practices with the Liverpool curriculum framework. With this better codifying of my practices it allows me to reflect more clearly and improve. It has also made me think about my placement in higher education.

I very much enjoy teaching workshops to postgrads and researchers. There are a lot more motivated compared to undergrads in my experience, in my experience of both. Bioinformatics feels unique in that there are very few biology undergraduates who seem interested in it. Naturally, postgraduates have a clearer view of what is required for research in their field.

Although I enjoy what I do and do not necessarily want to change to undergrad teaching, it is useful to learn good practices I can incorporate into my form and style of teaching. Gaining skills and accreditations in pedagogy will also help my future career path. With the completion of this patch I feel more comfortable in my mittens (workshops) but I feel I can also fit into different gloves if needed or my role changes in the future (teaching modules).

# Square peg finding a square hole: Fitting myself into the Higher education system

Up to this point in my teaching career I have been thinking on the micro level. I have focussed on what is best for each learner. I am now contemplating how I have fit myself into the Higher Education system? 

Unlike typical HE educators, I run 1-2 day workshops for postgrads and research staff (A1). These stand-alone micro scale courses have not previously required a large amount of curriculum design. This has changed with my involvement in NEOF (NERC Environmental Omics Facility) where we run a series of workshops over a year. Therefore, I have decided to reflect on my curriculum design (A5). To assist with this I focussed on the core value and six hallmarks of the Liverpool curriculum framework. 

## NEOF

I co-run the training subgroup at NEOF (NERC Environmental Omics Facility). NERC (Natural Environment Research Council) is part of UKRI and it is the driving force of investment in environmental science in the UK. 

The NEOF training subgroup improves the digital fluency of environmental scientists (postgrads & academic research staff) across the UK (V4). This is carried out by teaching bioinformatics to analyse environmental genomics data (A2). Bioinformatics is vital to the field of modern molecular biology (K1) (Cao et al, 2020). These skills and knowledge help with the learner’s research and future employability (V4). 

NEOF carries out research relevant to NERC. We use this experience and produce training that is research-connected. We use relevant datasets, and teach bioinformatic techniques used in research. Sharing our research experiences with these concepts and tools makes it more relevant and improves understanding (Lu et al, 2017) (K2).

## Workshop Design

To build up a curriculum you have to start with the building blocks. In our case these are workshops. Our workshops are 1-2 days, running from 10am-4pm with 3 breaks amounting to 1.5 hours. We use this time schedule to be inclusive to people of different needs (V1). Whether this is people who need to drop off/pick-up children or those who need to commute. 

Most of our workshops are free and online. The workshops are entirely funded by NERC. We started online due to necessity but continue because of feedback.  We cater to everyone in the UK including people in Northern Ireland. Online workshops are more accessible as our attendees do not need to organise travel and accommodation (V2).

The first day of a workshop starts with an icebreaker. This helps establish a learning environment and introduces scientists in the same field to each other, helping global citizenship (V2 & V3) (Mustafa & Yukselturk, 2022). We allow anonymous participation to improve inclusivity as anxiety is a barrier to learning (Sathy & Hogan, 2019). After the icebreaker we carry out a presentation to introduce them to the contents of the workshop and set the etiquette they are and we are expected to practise during the workshop. This is important to respect each other and our differences (V1) (Muñiz, 2019).

Primarily the workshop involves the learners running through and reading a html book. This contains theory, practice, MCQs, and exercises. They run through the materials at their own pace. This active learning approach is a central tenet of scientific teaching, a useful pedagogical framework for bioinformatics (K2, K3, K4, & V3) (Miller et al,  2008).

Through these workshops we purely train skills and do not grade our learners. Instead, we provide solutions to the exercises in the materials. This allows training-supported formative self-assessment which deepens learning (Andrade, 2019). We give our learners feedback when they ask for help and we evaluate their solution and understanding (A3, & K5).

## Curriculum design

At NEOF we run a series of workshops throughout a year, with 3-4 weeks between each. The same people will not attend all workshops so we ensure learners have the bioinformatic prerequisites before they attend. We have a variety of methods for this but I will focus on our division of our workshops. 

At the start of the series we run introductory courses. These act as the  prerequisite materials for our analysis workshops in the second half (K2). These include introductory courses to the coding languages; Bash, R, and Python, and an introduction to sequencing quality control. These workshops ease the learners into bioinformatics and provide essential skills and knowledge. This promotes learners’ digital fluency and confidence (V1). Our python course was created by a new member of the group with proficiency in python. We were able to train them to be a trainer and in turn they were able to expand our program. It is very beneficial to build a complimentary combination of skilled personnel in this manner (V2 & V4) (Aron et al, 2021).

On top of running these courses synchronously we also provide them to all learners attending our course specific workshops. We provide the materials, recordings, and a means to run through them. This ensures the learners can learn or refresh on the materials prior to the workshop. Providing online materials is valuable to postgraduate learners irrespective of their native language and promotes confidence with self-directed learning (A4, K4, V1, & V2) (Mello, 2016).

Although NERC funds more than biology, we at NEOF specifically help with biological questions through omics. Omics is the study of pools of biological molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins. This combined with the NERC remit of what areas of studies they fund, informs what types of analysis we teach (K1, & V4).

With the knowledge of my team and the NERC remit we run various different analysis specific workshops. These workshops do not require all the prerequisites and so we only give the learner the required prerequisite materials prior to the workshop. We ensure that these prerequisites are clearly specified and only the required workshop is provided before each course.

## Conclusion

At NEOF we provide a curriculum of bioinformatics based workshops. The main aim is to improve the digital fluency of postgraduates and researchers via bioinformatics. We are well placed to provide research-connected teaching in molecular biology of environmental sciences and primarily utilise self-assessment as a form of authentic assessment. To create global citizenship we use icebreakers so scientists can meet other scientists in the same field. Through many practices we try to be inclusive. This includes the online nature, and time structure of our workshops. Through gradual training we attempt to improve the confidence of learners. With the knowledge from this PGCAP, the Liverpool curriculum framework and the slow build up of my training provisions, I believe we are utilising a good curriculum design for online bioinformatics workshops (A5).

# (PART\*) Reflection of two observations of teaching and learning {-}

# All aboard! or: How to improve the introduction of a workshop with effective onboarding and Learning Outcomes

<center>
![](figures/train.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}
</center>

I have always asked my team members to discuss and give me feedback on my presentations and materials. I am a glutton for positive feedback but do not react as well to negative feedback. These 2 observations gave me a chance to discuss my teaching in a more formal process. With this I discovered 2 main improvements for my teaching practice.

## Dr Strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the Learning Outcome

<center>
![](figures/pyramid.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}
</center>

My first observation was with a senior colleague, Lu Mello. I have helped in the past with her ungraduate modules and we get on very well. She was therefore very enthusiastic to help me. Overall she was very positive and provided a great discussion. She helped me see how I cover all of the UKPSF. However, that discussion could never fit in a 500 word reflection, in fact I feel like I could have written 2X the amount in my patches. No surprise to you reading this portfolio I am sure. I therefore decided to focus on her advice in adding Learning Outcomes (LOs) to my workshops (A5).

Learning outcomes are important in higher education for a variety of reasons:

- Part of changes and standardisation caused by the Bologna Declaration (1999) (V4).
  - The Bologna declaration was intended to promote quality assurance and allow for the greater comparability and compatibility of University courses across Europe (Wächter., 2004).
  - The Berlin Communiqué (2003) first encouraged the use of Learning outcomes in these European processes (Sweetman et al., 2014).
- They Provide a good overview of the skills, knowledge, and/or competences to gain from the education (K3) (Dias, 2020).
  - Prospective learners can gain a clear view of the course, prior to applying (V1 & V2).

I have previously lacked affinity to producing learning outcomes. This is due to a variety of reasons:

- Bloom's taxonomy.
  - It is difficult to use Bloom's taxonomy for computer science education (Masapanta-Carrión, & Velázquez-Iturbide, 2018).
  - However, I discovered a combined SOLO and Bloom’s taxonomy for computer scientists, such as I, to use (V3 & K2) (Meerbaum-Salant et al., 2010). 
- Learners not reaching LOs
  - Can lead to demotivation as student may feel the failure is their fault (V1).
  - However, good learning outcomes that attempt to protect from loss of self-confidence can be created (Falout et al., 2009).

I am very happy with the feedback from my observer and how it has led me to stop worrying and love the Learning outcome. The feedback from my marker is generally positive again asking me to link to the Liverpool Curriculum Framework. However, this was addressed in Patch 4 which was submitted after this patch.

## A smooth on-ramp or: Effective onboarding to a course

<center>
![](figures/ramp.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}
</center>

My second observation was with a member of my NEOF training group, Katy Maher. Overall we both agreed my session  was successful. However, we both noticed that a few students struggled starting the practical portion. We have noticed this before but a solution was not immediately obvious and other work took precedence. With this part of the patch I was able to investigate and find possible solutions for improving my onboarding for those struggling (V1).

Effective onboarding can help student retention (V2) (Milner & Price, 2021). I currently set etiquette to help prevent misunderstanding and conflicts in a multicultural group, improving inclusivity (V1) (Franz et al., 2021).

Importantly in Bioinformatics open source software is primarily used, the majority of which have steep learning curves (K1) (Ngo et al., 2021). I therefore try to teach user-friendly tools to counteract demotivation at start (A1, K4, & V3) (Franz et al., 2021). Additionally, I train the learners on how to use the tools, a core competency for all bioinformaticians (A2, &V4) (Walch et al., 2014)

In the future I intend to improve the onboarding on my materials with the following:

- Demonstration of the online HTML book at the end of my first presentation (A5).
-  Incorporation of learning outcomes and goals to elucidate purpose (Hayes, 2014).
- Utilisation of narrative to introduce the practice dataset to invest the learners (K3) (McNett, 2016).

I am happy with the feedback from my observer and marker. I have some good areas to make instant improvements. My marker feedback encourages me to look at more frameworks. This will be good to do in the future but I am content with the amount of content I fit into this reflection.

## A murder of discussions

<center>
![](figures/murder of crows.png){style="width:1000px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}
</center>

Time to discuss the discussions. Although I constantly discuss how my workshops went with my team it was good to do it in a more formal manner and with someone I have not discussed my NEOF workshops with before. Although it will take more time I am looking forward to the incorporation of Learning Outcomes in my materials. It will also be useful to improve the onboarding of my workshops. These two improvement will hopefully allows learners to start off running.

# Self-evaluation and reflection of the sessions

The assignments included feedback from my observers.
However, as they are not my words I have not included them and only included my own self-evaluations and reflections on the sessions.

## Learning outcomes

The teaching session I created and ran went very well (A1 & A2). Learner’s were given a good introduction
to the day’s materials and they were engaged and motivated. However, my observer pointed out that I
could incorporate learning outcomes (LOs) into the materials and presentation better, and promote
networking. In this reflection I would like to focus on incorporating LOs for future courses (A5).

LOs are important in higher education as part of changes and standardisation caused by the Bologna
Declaration (1999) (V4). This agreement was intended to promote quality assurance and allow for the
greater comparability and compatibility of University courses across Europe (Wächter., 2004). The Bologna
Declaration was followed up by other agreements, including the Berlin Communiqué (2003). This first
encouraged the use of Learning outcomes in these European processes (Sweetman et al., 2014).

LOs assist learners by giving them a good overview of the skills, knowledge, and/or competences to gain
from the education (K3) (Dias, 2020). With my workshops this can give the prospective learner a clear view
of the course, prior to applying, so they know if it is relevant for them (V1 & V2). Currently we have a brief
explanation of the course. Including a bulleted list of learning outcomes can help set proper expectations of
prospective learners.

I have previously found designing learning objectives for computational biology to not be straightforward.
This is not uncommon with many computer science educators finding it difficult to determine the level of
Bloom’s taxonomy to use (Masapanta-Carrión, & Velázquez-Iturbide, 2018). There are various
evidence-informed recommendations to improve the creation of learning outcomes. One particularly
interesting one I will use is the combined SOLO and Bloom’s taxonomy (V3) (Meerbaum-Salant et al., 2010).
This taxonomy was specifically designed for computer scientists such as myself (K2). This utilises three of
the five SOLO taxonomies; unistructural, multistructural, and relational. Within each of these are three
subcategories from Bloom’s taxonomy; Understanding, Applying, and Creation.

An additional issue I find with LOs is when a learner does not reach the expected learning outcomes. This
can lead to demotivation as LOs can make it seem like the failure is the student’s fault (V1). However, good
learning outcomes that attempt to protect from loss of self-confidence can be created (Falout et al., 2009).
I need to carefully consider what taxonomy level the training is intended to reach. Depending on the topic,
as I do not purely teach computer science, I can use Bloom’s or the combined SOLO and Bloom’s taxonomy.

It is tempting to try and pick a higher complexity level so you feel you are giving the best value of teaching.
However, higher complexity does not necessarily mean better and it is best to create a realistic learning
outcome (K4). On the other hand, it is still useful to consider the higher levels of taxonomy. This can be
used to try to develop deeper cognitive processing in learners where appropriate (Adams, 2015).

I am happy with my current teaching. There is still room for improvement and I aim to add LOs to my
registration forms and materials (A5). I feel more confident using the SOLO and Bloom’s combined
taxonomy than Bloom’s for my area of teaching. I will add a section in the workshop feedback forms to
assess the usefulness and quality of the LOs I add (K5). I hope their incorporation will improve the learning
experience and help with material creation in the future.

## Effective onboarding

I have received very positive feedback from my observer. Katy is a member of the NEOF training subgroup
so was able to observe the entire day’s session (9.30am-4pm). The main area for further development was
to explain the use of the online html book and how to start after the presentation. I believe this ties into
improving my onboarding to assist struggling learners (V1). There are a variety of methods I am aiming to
use to do this. This includes adding a section at the end of the first presentation to set them up for the
practical, and improving the stated goals and outcomes of the course.

Onboarding can be an effective method to prepare learners for the course. In online courses this can
introduce the learners to the technologies to be used, the materials to be covered, and how assignments
will be carried out. Effective onboarding can help student retention and the materials can be useful for
their future reference (V2) (Milner & Price, 2021). Etiquette can be set to help prevent misunderstanding
and conflicts in a multicultural group, improving inclusivity (V1) (Franz et al., 2021).

The online learning of bioinformatics can be halted by the various tools and software that need to be learnt
such as Zoom, Slack, webVNC, RStudio, Juptyer notebook, etc. Primarily bioinformatic software packages
that academics use are open-source. Unfortunately the majority of open-source software packages have a
significant barrier to entry with steep learning curves, in part due to poor documentation (K1) (Ngo et al.,
2021). To counteract demotivation at the start of the course I use user-friendly tools in the materials, where
possible (A1, K4, & V3) (Franz et al., 2021). Additionally, I train the learners on how to use the tools (A2).
This is seen as a core competency for all bioinformaticians (V4) (Walch et al., 2014).

Unfortunately I have not focussed on onboarding the materials. To improve on this I will give a
demonstration of the online HTML book at the end of my first presentation (A5). I will show them different
sections of it such as the theory, practice, interactive multiple choice questions, and exercises. In past
courses I have found a small number of students have been confused as to how to start the practical. I have
found this out by regularly asking students if they need assistance and by being able to check their progress
on their virtual computer I have access to (A4 & K5).

More generally, to improve onboarding I will improve the introduction of the course. I will incorporate
learning outcomes and goals into the presentation and materials to help elucidate the purpose of the
course (Hayes, 2014). I will also use narrative to introduce the dataset being used in a way that invests the
learners (K3) (McNett, 2016).

I am very happy with my feedback from my observer. However, I agree with their criticism of my
onboarding. I have previously focussed on effective onboarding on the bioinformatic concepts and tools. I
will now focus on improving the more general onboarding of the course. This will involve setting up the
students to start practical sessions more smoothly, improving the learning goals, and giving better context
to the biological datasets that are used through storytelling.

# (PART\*) Continuing Professional Development {-}

# Where am I? or: Am I a teacher or a facilitator of learning?

<center>
![](figures/pendant.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}
</center>

Quite a pedantic question but pedantry can be a bonus when teaching. I believe teachers are facilitators of learning and vice versa. Instead, the terms encourages us to reflect on our teaching style. Learning is the important thing, do what is best for the learners when you teach. It may seem obvious, but when you are creating materials or learning new teaching practices it is always better to ask "Will this improve the facilitation of learning?" rather than "Will this improve my teaching?".

I believe myself to be an effective teacher. I receive a lot of positive feedback from learners. I have a lot of experience running workshops throughout my academic career. I have the time to teach, being in a ~90% teaching role, there is always non-teaching tasks to carry out. Very importantly to this PGCAP and this patch, I try to constantly improve my teaching in various ways.

## Be kind, rewind

<center>
![](figures/vhs.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}
</center>

I learnt my field and experienced a lot of good and poor teaching practices through my BSc in Microbiology and MSc in bioinformatics (K1). From the start of my academic career I was involved in running bioinformatic workshops. I have run over fifty 1-5 day workshops over my 8 years working in university genome centres. I am now the CGR (Centre for Genomic  Research) training lead (A1 & A2).

My main role is being part of the NEOF training group. We teach environmental scientists how to use bioinformatics for their research. We effectively use multimedia through Zoom, OBS, Slack, webVNC, and HTML books to effectively carry out e-learning (Bikowski & Casal, 2018; Mayer, 2017).

## The present

<center>
![](figures/gift_tag.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}
</center>

I have recently improved my teaching my carrying out the Foundations in Learning and Teaching in Higher Education (FLTHE) gaining Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA) (A5). I am now following this up with this PGCAP to become a FHEA. 

Through this PGCAP I have learnt I teach with the following practices and principles:

- Blended learning approach (K3).
- String materials with variety of different activities (K2) (Bao, 2020).
- Approachable and non-judgemental (A4) (Authment & Dormire, 2020).
- Feedback to students is important (A3).
  - Best to praise effort than success to motivate learners (Jenkins et al, 2015).
- Mistakes are normal in bioinformatics (V2) (Hochanadel & Finamore, 2015).
  - Learning debugging is vital (Li et al, 2019).
- Do not trivialise difficulty of topic, it can lead to demotivation (V1) [Link](https://www.edutopia.org/article/3-phrases-can-demotivate-students-math-class/#:~:text=By%20calling%20something%20%E2%80%9Ceasy%2C%E2%80%9D,that%20something%20was%20%E2%80%9Ceasy.%E2%80%9D Links to an external site.).
- Good materials to allow students to work at own pace is good for bioinformatics (Abrahamsson & Dávila López, 2021).

## PGCAP Recap

<center>
![](figures/recap.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}
</center>

Through the patches of this PGCAP I have found new ways to improve my teaching. This has been carried out through my own reflections and discussions with my colleagues (K6). Additionally, feedback from learners is extremely valuable (K5). These include:

- Adding interactive MCQs into my e-materials.
  - Act as formative assessment allowing leaner self-assessment (V3) (McCallum & Milner, 2021).
  - Guides interrogation & interpretation of output from bioinformatics tools (K2).
- Use of SOLO & Bloom taxonomy to make Learning Outcomes in line with Bologana Declaration (V4) (Meerbaum-Salant et al, 2010).
- Improving onboarding at the start of workshops (Milner & Price, 2021).

## The next step

<center>
![](figures/step.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}
</center>

For the next stage of my teaching career I would like to become the CGR training manager. I describe this through a gap analysis:

- Where am I now: NEOF & CGR training lead.
- What do I want to be?: CGR training manager.
- What is the gap between where I am now and where I want to be?: Conflict management & Leadership skills. Gain accreditations such as FHEA.
- What do I need to do?: Discuss and organise with higher ups. 

As for how to improve my teaching I have the following 2 main points:

- Improve feedback from students via better questions (K5).
- Include videos to describe complicate concepts into my e-materials (K2, K3, & K4) (Brame, 2016).

## Mountains & Valleys

<center>
![](figures/mountain_and_valley.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}
</center>

Overall my feedback form my marker was positive. They were happy with my current progress and my plans for the future. They wondered what my plans for my next PGCAP module was. I am thinking of further improving my e-materials, through reflecting on feedback and finding different plug-ins I can use. One of these including adding more videos. I would also like to disseminate the use of e-materials via user group meetings and conferences. This would be incorporated with a guide on how I make mine.

A major criticism of the patch was the lack of literature citations. I addressed this by adding citations in the feedback comments and I have cited these in this part of the portfolio. I did not include these as I initially thought the patch was more discussing our own thoughts and didn't need citations. Although I consider myself an excellent teacher I am still quite new to the field of pedagogy and humanities/social sciences in general.

My maker asked about a Gap or SWOT analysis. I had included this but weaved it into the text. I addressed this in the feedback comments but have also made it more explicit in this part of the portfolio.

Overall I am happy with my teaching. I have a lot of experience in teaching bioinformatics. I always aim to be the best teacher I can be. This PGCAP has obstructed my time to work on making more materials for NEOF but I am happy it has given me many points to improve on and helped me realise all the good practices I am already doing. Bad things have happened in my career and life but I have come far and I intend to keep going.

# Hiking through my teaching career

I thoroughly enjoy teaching bioinformatics and I have benefited greatly from this PGCAP module. It has taught me interesting pedagogy, given me the opportunity to read academic literature, and reflect on my current teaching practices. Through this I have gained more confidence in my teaching, and incorporated new practices. I plan to become the CGR (Centre for Genomics Research) training manager. The skills, knowledge, and accreditations through the FLTHE and this PGCAP will assist me in fulfilling these goals.

## The path taken

I have been in academia for over 12 years. Through a BSc in Microbiology and a MSc in Bioinformatics I experienced a lot of good and bad teaching practices (K1). I was chairperson of a society which gave me practice and affinity in public speaking, organisation, and hosting.

Through my 8 years as a bioinformatician in academic genome centres I have been involved in running over 50 bioinformatics workshops (1-5 days each). Initially, I learnt a lot following the lead of my fellow experienced bioinformaticians. Now I am the training lead at the Centre for Genomic Research (CGR) (A1 & A2). I am a founder of the NEOF (NERC Environmental Omics Facility) training team and currently run about 12 workshops a year.

With the start of NEOF during lockdowns it gave us the opportunity to start from scratch while producing online courses. To accommodate this I learnt how to use Zoom, OBS, and slack, making online learning easier (K4). I learnt to create html books with R bookdown. This makes attractive materials with a digestible layout that are easily accessible via a website. Additionally, there are many interactive parts I can add and the website can be kept up to date so previous learners can view the updated materials if they refer to them in the future.

## The scenic view

I thoroughly enjoy teaching and I want to improve and open more opportunities for myself. For this I successfully carried out the Foundations in Learning and Teaching in Higher Education (FLTHE). This was then followed by this PGCAP (A5). Reflecting on my teaching practice and codifying it in terms of pedagogical theory has been beneficial so I understand better what I am doing well and what can be improved. I teach with a blended learning approach, focussing primarily on active learning via strong materials which contain a variety of different activities (K2 & K3). I have two main catchphrases I use that encapsulate my teaching style. 

### “There is no such thing as a stupid question, only stupid answers by me”

This attempts to motivate students to engage in learning by showing I am an approachable presence that will not judge any learners (A4). Providing feedback is important to students (A3). I now make a conscious effort to praise learners for their effort rather than success. This helps motivate students and aims to teach them that mistakes are common in bioinformatics and coding in general (V2). It is not about not making mistakes instead it is having the ability to debug and address mistakes. 

### “Difficult subjects can’t be made easy, but learning can”

We should not trivialise the complexity of computational biology. It is difficult. Saying something is easy when a learner finds it difficult will demotivate them (V1). I aim to facilitate learning with the best practices. My main focus is on very effective materials. Good materials allow them to learn at their own pace and means they have something good to refer to in the future. A lot of bioinformatics is running through processes and so it is always good to have a good guide to follow.

## My improved gear

With this PGCAP I have found areas of development via pedagogical literature. I am now adding interactive MCQs into the materials. These act as a form of formative assessment that allows the learner to carry out self assessment (V3). I use these as recap sections of chapters and  to direct learners to the correct parts of file outputs. Bioinformatics involves many different types of files and so interrogation and interpretation of these is very important (K2).

I have previously found the use of Learning outcomes to be unintuitive. This is a common feeling in computational subjects. I have learnt of the SOLO and Bloom combined taxonomy to produce learning outcomes. With this I have started making learning outcomes that I feel are beneficial and in line with the Bologna Declaration (V4).

In past workshops some learners struggle starting. One of my observers noticed this and I now plan to make the workshop onboarding clearer. We regularly discuss our teaching practices in our team to improve our teaching (K6).

Through student verbal and written feedback I will monitor whether my additions and improvements are beneficial (K5). In addition, I will continue to find any areas of improvement through CPD and feedback.

## The path ahead

My current plan now is to become the official teaching manager of CGR. I would like a small teaching team with which I have authority to make decisions and delegate tasks without having to ask CGR higher-ups for constant permission. I have discussed with my line manager who is keen and discussions are taking place. Prior to being a manager I would like to improve my conflict management and leadership skills. I also want to constantly improve my teaching skills so this PGCAP will be beneficial and I would like to advance onto the PGDip and MA. 
In terms of direct teaching I would like to improve the feedback forms we provide to students. I have no knowledge of academic theory as to what constitutes good feedback questions. Instead, I do what seems good. 

I would like to include more videos in my materials to demonstrate how to use programs with complicated GUIs or complicated techniques. This would require learning difficult video editing software. Due to this I believe it best to focus on other improvements. It is easy to theorise the best materials but we also need to manage our tasks to produce the best materials with the time and skills we already have.

## Taking off my boots

I am an inclusive effective teacher. Through this PGCAP module I have been able to develop, expand, and reflect on my teaching practices. I am incorporating interactive MCQs and adding Learning outcomes to my materials. I aim to continue my improvement and I plan to become the CGR training manager in the future.

# (PART\*) Professional discussion {.unnumbered}

# Improv vs script reading or: how I best prepare for public speaking

<center>
![](figures/stage.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}
</center>

For this patch I had a list of questions to prepare followed by an interview style discussion where I was asked some of the questions. This was a nice way to reflect on and discuss my teaching practices in a more informal manner.

For this discussion I wrote out a list of notes for each question. I made them quite light and then practiced these answers a few times each. This is generally how I practice presentations and explanations. I don't use a script instead having points I can improvise from. This leads to a more natural way of talking without forgetting important details. I do not have the memory to go completely off the cuff. I also find it would be quite a disorganised conversation and I would probably jump about a lot. Equally, a script would not be good as I am not good at live reading, generally having an awkward rhythm and pronouncing words wrong. Instead, I am a more confident public speaker when I have practiced and I have a good structure to go from.

## Q&A

The preparation, discussion, and marker feedback were all positive and fruitful. I hope my passion for teaching and the pride in my work came through. My marker feedback indicates that is the case which I am happy about. The feedback also encouraged me to try to further disseminate my work and evaluating my workbooks for my next PGCAP module. I think this is a great idea and what I will use it for my research project.

I have been able to reflect and develop a lot during this module. I have enjoyed it even if it took a lot of time. In the end it has shown me how good a teacher I am, and how to further improve my teaching.

## Evidence or: how I met descriptor 2 of the UKPSF

<center>![](figures/evidence.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}</center>

As well as proving to myself that I have improved, If I am to successfully to complete this PGCAP and gain FHEA I need to prove this to you, the reader and my examiner. Therefore this section will aim to demonstrate how I have met descriptor 2 of the UKPSF.

I am the CGR training lead and a member of the NEOF training group (A1 & A2). I am the sole organiser, creator, and runner of CGR workshops. I get administration help and help from other staff member as demonstrators. As part of the NEOF training group I am also the main lead of some workshops but also help in workshops led by my colleagues. I have run over 50 workshops (1-5 days long), currently running/co-running \~12 a year.

I give verbal feedback to students and encourage self-assessment through MCQs (A3). To motivate students I try to praise their efforts rather than success. Additionally, I try to not demotivate students by separating mistakes from them. I say "the mistake" rather than "your mistake". I encourage questions so I can provide feedback by being approachable and understanding (V4). I like to say "There is no such thing as a silly question, just silly answers by me".

Prior to this PGCAP I completed the FLTHE (A5). I have read a lot of literature and am constantly improving my skills in pedagogy and bioinformatics. I have learnt environmental biology and python from my fellow team members and attending workshops myself. Inside and outside of this PGCAP I constantly discuss my teaching with my colleagues.

I teach bioinformatics. I have a BSc in Microbiology and a MSc in Bioinformatics (K1). I also carry out a good amount of research in bioinformatics with 23 published papers. As part of my duties in CGR I was part of COG-UK (COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium). This was the consortium that sequenced COVID-19 in the UK to track the spreading of all the strains.

I teach with a blended learning approach, focussing primarily on active learning via strong materials which contain a variety of different activities (K2 & K3). I primarily teach online so I have invested heavily into learning and using good technologies (K4). These include Zoom, OBS, Slack, webVNC, and Bookdown. I Use active learning via self paced materials with theory, practice, MCQs, and exercises as it is a central tenet of scientific teaching, a useful pedagogical framework for bioinformatics (K2, K3, K4, & V3) (Miller et al, 2008).

To evaluate my teaching I constantly ask for student feedback and measure their performance (K5). I use google forms as end of course surveys. I monitor their progress via the webVNC. Importantly I ensure they are comfortable to ask questions.

My team and I constantly discuss feedback and use this to improve (K6). We have meetings where we discuss the feedback. We ask each other's opinions on our materials. Additionally, we will comment on each other's presentations. Through this I have made various improvements to my teaching such as improving onboarding, & adding LOs to my materials.

I promote participation by creating a friendly and approachable environment (V2). I have many avenues of asking questions (voice, text, emails) so anxious learners feel comfortable to do so. I try to be welcoming to people from all cultures, sexes, races, classes etc. (V1) As an example I include my pronouns (he/him) in my Zoom name.

I have incorporated many evidence-informed approaches (V3). Some include:

-   Incorporating MCQ macro design strategies, such as interspersed answers (V3) (Söbke & Mosebach, 2020)
-   Learner engagement through storytelling, case studies, and interesting context (K3 & V3)(Hoffer, 2020)
-   Workshop icebreakers to help establish a learning environment and introduce scientists in the same field to each other (V2 & V3) (Mustafa & Yukselturk, 2022).
-   Using SOLO and Bloom taxonomy for LOs of bioinformatics (V3 & K2) (Meerbaum-Salant et al., 2010).

Bioinformatics is a very important skill in biology. It will help the research and employability of learners (V4). I have also started including Learning Outcomes into my materials which was an important part of changes and standardisation caused by the Bologna Declaration (1999) (V4).

My main takeaways for improvement from this PGCAP are:

-   Addition of MCQs in my materials
-   Use of Learning outcomes
-   Improving onboarding
-   Evaluate effectiveness of my HTML materials
-   Disseminate the good teaching practices I have for bioinformatics
-   Improve my leadership and conflict management skills
-   Gain more accreditations

## The Podium

<center>![](figures/champagne.png){style="width:200px; background: white; border-radius:15px; border: 5px white solid"}</center>

That is the end of my portfolio. As I have said many times, I believe myself to be an effective teacher. I have many good practices. I run many workshops. I am constantly trying to improve and keep up with the latest tools and research in my field. I have a great team at NEOF. I receive very good feedback from learners. They constantly say how they came out of our workshops with a much stronger level of understanding. Additionally, they also comment on how friendly and approachable we are.

My job is primarily teaching and I am mainly autonomous in my role. I aim to become the CGR training manager. I already manage all the CGR bioinformatics training provisions. However, I do not have the authority to make major decisions and I do not have a team I lead. I will continue to work hard and smart to reach my goals.

Through this PGCAP I have learnt a lot and reflected on a lot. It will be nice to have some time to absorb my learning and get back to some important work in my main role. I hope I have successfully demonstrated that I meet descriptor 2 of the UKPSF and you have somewhat enjoyed reading this portfolio. Thanks for reading.
