# Welcome

Welcome, this is my portfolio for the PGCAP (Postgraduate Certificate of Academic Practice) I completed in 2024.
In essence the course is a degree for higher education (i.e. education at the University level).

The portfolio covers many topics and is related to teaching bioinformatics primarily to PhD students and early career researchers.

In the portfolio each section is split into two. The first is a more informal introduction to the topic/s. The second is a more formal essay/report with citations. Feel free to read only the first parts which summarise the most important points in the second part. I hope you find it interesting and engaging.

For the true introduction please read onto the next page.
